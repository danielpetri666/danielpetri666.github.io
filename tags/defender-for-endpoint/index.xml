A lot has happened since the beginning of DUDE.
Let me share the initial purpose of the DUDE solution to refresh your memories:
The purpose of this solution is to have dynamic user groups based on any attribute supported in Azure AD groups and a corresponding assigned device group. The script will then check who’s in the user group, grab all the users devices from Intune and add them to the corresponding device group. If a user is removed from the user group, their device will also automatically be removed from the device group.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://dp666.net/blog/dynamic-user-and-device-enumeration-on-steroids/cover.png"/></item></channel></rss>
