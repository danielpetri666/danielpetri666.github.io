So the purpose of this post is to help you automate this process with the help of a PowerShell runbook in azure automation.
Updated 2021–10–10 — Thanks to Michael Mardahl for pointing out that managed identity should be used instead of client secrets.
I will explain how you could set this up by creating dynamic user groups, for example for the HR department, and then have the Runbook gather all the HR users devices from Intune and add them to the correct device group automatically. If the user attribute changes, for example if a user leaves the HR department, their devices will be removed from the device group automatically.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://dp666.net/blog/dynamic-device-scope-tags-with-azure-automation/cover.png"/></item></channel></rss>
