A lot has happened since the beginning of DUDE.\nLet me share the initial purpose of the DUDE solution to refresh your memories:\nThe purpose of this solution is to have dynamic user groups based on any attribute supported in Azure AD groups and a corresponding assigned device group. The script will then check who’s in the user group, grab all the users devices from Intune and add them to the corresponding device group. If a user is removed from the user group, their device will also automatically be removed from the device group.\nNew features has arrived and DUDE is now a broader automation solution to help you manage your users and devices with ease.\nDUDE Architecture \u0026amp; Features # DUDE User Groups (Required)\nDUDE will loop through all DUDE user groups and get the user group members. User Group Members Devices (Required)\nDUDE will grab the user group members devices from Intune based on the primary user of the device in Intune. DUDE Device Groups (Required)\nDUDE will add the users devices to a corresponding device group. If a user is removed from the user group, their device will also automatically be removed from the device group. Scope Tags (Optional)\nTo be able to delegate permissions and other important things in a dynamic and automated way, I highly recommend assigning scope tags to the DUDE Device groups. This is a one time setup per DUDE device group. Administrative Units (Optional)\nThe same goes for admin units. We want to be able to delegate permissions to things like Azure LAPS, BitLocker etc. With Scope Tags and Admin Units we can really scope just the permissions needed for IT support or local IT. If you enable this feature DUDE will add and remove users and devices to a corresponding Admin Unit based on the DUDE user and device groups. Defender for Endpoint (Optional)\nThe latest addition to DUDE is the automation of machine tags in Defender for Endpoint. If you enable this feature DUDE will add or remove machine tags on devices onboarded in Defender for Endpoint based on the DUDE user group members devices. This tag can then be used dynamically in device groups in Defender for Endpoint to help with delegation, policies, exclusions etc. DUDE Pre-Reqs # You need the following in place to setup DUDE:\nDUDE Users Azure AD Groups DUDE Devices Azure AD Groups Scope Tags (Optional) Administrative Units (Optional) Defender for Endpoint (Optional) You can create all this manually by following my older blog posts but nobody likes manual work so we will use PowerShell instead. Grab the script on my GitHub: DUDE-CreateStuff.ps1\nThis script uses “Get-MsalToken”, if you don’t know what that is, head over to this great post by Ben Reader: Authenticating to Microsoft Graph with PowerShell\nBefore you run the script, make sure to update the variables. You can add as many groups as you want. Remember that it’s critical that the UserGroupName, DeviceGroupName and AdminUnitName variables are consistent and have a matching ending. Other variables can be set however you prefer but these ones are critical:\nUserGroupName should always start with “DUDE Users “\nDeviceGroupName should always start with “DUDE Devices “\nAdminUnitName should always start with “DUDE ”\nWhatever you choose to put after this in the names have to match between the three. In this post I will use the following names:\nUser Group Names:\nDUDE Users Rock\nDUDE Users Metal\nDevice Group Names:\nDUDE Devices Rock\nDUDE Devices Metal\nAdmin Unit Names:\nDUDE Rock\nDUDE Metal\n#region Variables $ClientId = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; $TenantId = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; $CreateScopeTags = $True $CreateAdminUnits = $True $Groups = @( [PSCustomObject]@{ UserGroupName = \u0026#34;DUDE Users Rock\u0026#34; UserGroupDescription = \u0026#34;Rock Users\u0026#34; UserGroupMembershipRule = \u0026#34;(user.department -eq `\u0026#34;Rock`\u0026#34;)\u0026#34; DeviceGroupName = \u0026#34;DUDE Devices Rock\u0026#34; DeviceGroupDescription = \u0026#34;Rock Users Devices\u0026#34; ScopeTagName = \u0026#34;Rock\u0026#34; # Only needed if $CreateScopeTags = $True ScopeTagDescription = \u0026#34;Rock\u0026#34; # Only needed if $CreateScopeTags = $True AdminUnitName = \u0026#34;DUDE Rock\u0026#34; # Only needed if $CreateAdminUnits = $True AdminUnitDescription = \u0026#34;Rock\u0026#34; # Only needed if $CreateAdminUnits = $True } [PSCustomObject]@{ UserGroupName = \u0026#34;DUDE Users Metal\u0026#34; UserGroupDescription = \u0026#34;Metal Users\u0026#34; UserGroupMembershipRule = \u0026#34;(user.department -eq `\u0026#34;Metal`\u0026#34;)\u0026#34; DeviceGroupName = \u0026#34;DUDE Devices Metal\u0026#34; DeviceGroupDescription = \u0026#34;Metal Users Devices\u0026#34; ScopeTagName = \u0026#34;Metal\u0026#34; # Only needed if $CreateScopeTags = $True ScopeTagDescription = \u0026#34;Metal\u0026#34; # Only needed if $CreateScopeTags = $True AdminUnitName = \u0026#34;DUDE Metal\u0026#34; # Only needed if $CreateAdminUnits = $True AdminUnitDescription = \u0026#34;Metal\u0026#34; # Only needed if $CreateAdminUnits = $True } ) #endregion The script output should look something like this:\nGroup 1 of 2: Rock Usergroup \u0026#34;DUDE Users Rock\u0026#34; was successfully created Devicegroup \u0026#34;DUDE Devices Rock\u0026#34; was successfully created Scopetag \u0026#34;Rock\u0026#34; was successfully created Scopetag \u0026#34;Rock\u0026#34; was successfully assigned AdminUnit \u0026#34;DUDE Rock\u0026#34; was successfully created Group 2 of 2: Metal Usergroup \u0026#34;DUDE Users Metal\u0026#34; was successfully created Devicegroup \u0026#34;DUDE Devices Metal\u0026#34; was successfully created Scopetag \u0026#34;Metal\u0026#34; was successfully created Scopetag \u0026#34;Metal\u0026#34; was successfully assigned AdminUnit \u0026#34;DUDE Metal\u0026#34; was successfully created You’re now ready to setup DUDE!\nDUDE Setup # First we need to create our function app!

Select “managed identities” as the application type and open your system assigned managed identity. The object ID value matches the object ID of the managed identity that you previously created.\nSelect “permissions” and it should look something like this:\nHead back to Function App — Microsoft Azure, select your function app, select “App files”, select “profile.ps1”, remove the following lines or use # and click “Save”\nSelect “Functions”, click “Create”, select “Timer trigger”, add a name and a schedule.

Copy the script from my GitHub: DUDE.ps1, paste it in “run.ps1” and make sure to update the variables before you hit “Save”.\nAfter the function has executed according to your schedule, select “Monitor” and select the latest invocation and you should see a log like this:\nThis log is great for troubleshooting and since we had the $RunLevel set to “Debug”, no changes where made but we can easily see what changes will be done when we change the $RunLevel to “Prod”.\nWhen you feel happy with the output, select “Code + Test”, change $RunLevel to “Prod” in “run.ps1” and hit “Save”:\nAgain, after the function has executed according to your schedule, select “Monitor” and select the latest invocation and you should see a log like this:\nThat’s it! We’re done! You have now automated the dynamic population of device groups in Azure AD, dynamic user and device population in Admin Units and dynamic Machine Tags in Defender for Endpoint based on dynamic user groups.\nHope this makes your admin life easier! To be continued…\n🤘🏻\nDUDE FAQ # I want to have other names on my groups, admin units and tags, is that possible?\nYes, just make sure that the user group names in Azure AD starts with “DUDE Users “ and that the device group names in Azure AD starts with “DUDE Devices “ and that the admin units in Azure AD starts with “DUDE “ and that whatever you choose to put after this in the names match between the three. You can for example use “DUDE Users Sweden”, “DUDE Devices Sweden” and “DUDE Sweden”. I want to use another Azure AD attribute to my dynamic user groups, is that possible?\nYes, you can use any supported dynamic membership rule in the user groups. I want to use a different scope tag name than the group names, is that possible?\nYes, you can name the scope tags anything you want. The scope tag part is a once per device group setup and/or assignment. What will the Machine Tag be in Defender for Endpoint and what happens to other existing tags?\nThe machine tag will be the ending of the device group name. If the device group is called “DUDE Devices IT” the Machine Tag will be “IT”. DUDE will not change any other existing tags in Defender for Endpoint. I want to apply specific configuration to my devices during the autopilot process, is that possible?\nYes, nested groups will be excluded so you can use nested groups to include your autopilot devices in the device groups.

If the user attribute changes, for example if a user leaves the HR department, their devices will be removed from the device group automatically.\nNote that it’s critical that the user and device group names are consistent and have a matching ending. The first part of the group names will need to be defined in the azure functions application settings as “UserGroupNames” and “DeviceGroupNames”.\nIf you enter the following application settings:\nName = UserGroupNames\nValue = Endpoint-DUDE Users Name = DeviceGroupNames\nValue = Endpoint-DUDE Devices All your user group names should start with “Endpoint-DUDE Users” and all your device group names should start with “Endpoint-DUDE Devices”. Whatever you choose to put after this in the group names have to match between the two.\nExample\nUser Group Names:\nEndpoint-DUDE Users HR Endpoint-DUDE Users IT Endpoint-DUDE Users Sweden Endpoint-DUDE Users North Europe Device Group Names:\nEndpoint-DUDE Devices HR Endpoint-DUDE Devices IT Endpoint-DUDE Devices Sweden Endpoint-DUDE Devices North Europe There are two new settings in this script, “DeviceFilter” and “RunLevel”, which is controlled via the azure functions application settings with the following options:\nName = DeviceFilter\nValue = “All” or “Managed” (All will include all Intune and Azure AD devices. Managed will include all Intune and only managed Azure AD devices.) Name = RunLevel\nValue = “Prod” or “Debug” (Use Prod to make changes. Debug for logging only.) Another new feature in this script is that it will match users and devices primarily based on registeredOwner from the Azure AD device object and fallback to userPrincipalName from the Intune device object. This means that if you change primary user on a device, for example from a HR user to a IT user, the device will automatically be removed from the HR device group and added to the IT device group.\nLet’s dig in…\nUser \u0026amp; Device Groups # To make this as dynamic as possible we would want to create dynamic user groups based on a user attribute. In this example I will create two dynamic user groups based on the departments “HR” and “IT”. DUDE in the group names stands for Dynamic User and Device Enumeration. Head over to Groups — Microsoft Azure to create our groups.\nUser group 1 — HR\nUser group 2 — IT\nFor each dynamic user group we need to create the corresponding device group. The device groups will have the assigned membership type so that our function can add and remove devices.\nDevice group 1 — HR\nDevice group 2 — IT\nScope Tags # Head over to Endpoint Manager roles — Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center to create scope tags for our newly created device groups.\nAzure Functions # Let’s create our function app! Go to Function App — Microsoft Azure, click “Create” and fill the required information and click “Next”\nSelect a storage account, Windows as the operating system and the desired Plan. I will not go into azure functions pricing in this post, you can read about it here, however there are some limitations that we need to consider like the fact that the consumption plan have a maximum runtime of 10 min. More info about azure functions scale and hosting can be found here. For the purpose of this blog I will select the consumption plan and hit “Next”\nLeave the Enable network injection off and click “Next”\nEnable application insight and click “Next”\nAdd any desired tags and click “Next”.\nClick “Create”\nWe will use a managed identity to access our resources securely. When the deployment is completed, head back to Function App — Microsoft Azure, select your newly created function app, select “Identity”, enable system assigned managed identity, hit save and make a note of the “Object (principal) ID”\nWe need to add the permissions needed via PowerShell. Install the AzureAD module if you don’t already have (Install-Module AzureAD). Make sure to update the $TenantID and $PrincipalID variables before executing\n# Variables $TenantID = \u0026#34;.onmicrosoft.com\u0026#34; $PrincipalID = \u0026#34;e2deedc8-390b-4c25-a456-7bc8ad3ff520\u0026#34; # Add permissions $Permissions = \u0026#34;Device.Read.All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Group.Read.All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;GroupMember.ReadWrite.All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;User.Read.All\u0026#34; Connect-AzureAD -TenantId $TenantID $GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -SearchString \u0026#34;Microsoft Graph\u0026#34; | Select-Object -first 1 $AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object { $Permissions -contains $_.Value -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains \u0026#34;Application\u0026#34; } foreach ($Role in $AppRole) { New-AzureAdServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $PrincipalID -PrincipalId $PrincipalID -ResourceId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId -Id $Role.Id } Head over to Enterprise applications — Microsoft Azure to verify the permissions. Select “managed identities” as the application type and open your system assigned managed identity. The object ID value matches the object ID of the managed identity that you previously created.\nSelect “permissions” and it should look something like this:\nHead back to Function App — Microsoft Azure, select your function app, select “App files”, select “profile.ps1”, remove the following lines or use # and click “Save”\nIt’s time to configure our application settings. We need to add the following application settings:\nName = UserGroupNames\nValue = “” Name = DeviceGroupNames\nValue = “” Name = DeviceFilter\nValue = “All” or “Managed” (All will include all Intune and Azure AD devices. Managed will include all Intune and only managed Azure AD devices.) Name = RunLevel\nValue = “Prod” or “Debug” (Use Prod to make changes. Debug for logging only.) Go to “Configuration” and click on “New application setting” to add the desired values for each config\nIf you choose to include managed devices and run this in debug mode it should look like this:\nSelect “Functions”, click “Create”, select “Timer trigger”, add a name and a schedule. In my example “0 0 11,23 * * *” will schedule this to run at 11 and 23 (UTC) every day. Hit “Create”\nOpen the newly created function\nSelect “Code + Test” and remove any existing code from “run.ps1”\nCopy the script from my github Intune/DUDE-AzureFunctions.ps1 at main · danielmoonpetri/Intune (github.com) ,paste it in “run.ps1” and hit “Save”\nSelect “Test/Run” and hit “Run”\nSince we ran in debug mode we can review the output before moving this to production and making any changes\nWhen we are happy with the results we can put this into production by going back to the application settings and change the “RunLevel” from “Debug” to “Prod” and it should look something like this:\nNow the next function execution will proceed and make changes to the groups. We can wait for the timer to run or run it manually again. Let’s head back to the function again and run this manually\nSelect “Code + Test”, select “Test/Run” and hit “Run”\nWe can now see any changes made in the logs\nResults # After the function have executed according to our schedule or manually we can see the following results:\nDevice group members\nDevice Scope Tags\nLogging # All actions will be logged in the audit logs\nIf we go to our function and check under monitor we will see status and runtime\nIf we open the invocation details we will get more information\nThe End # That’s it! We have now automated the device group assignments based on dynamic user groups and added scope tags. All we have to do now is to add more dynamic user groups, empty device group, assign scope tags and the function will take care of the rest.\nEnjoy!\n","date":"9 December 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/dynamic-device-scope-tags-with-azure-functions/","section":"Blog","summary":"In this previous blog post I showed you how to set dynamic device scope tags with azure automation.
